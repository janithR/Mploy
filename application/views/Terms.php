        8. M-Ploy’s Liability.
        The M-Ploy Sites act as, among other things, venues for (i) employers to post job opportunities and search for and evaluate job candidates and (ii) candidates to provide their personal details which is necessary for the Resume. M-Ploy does screen Profiles offered. M-Ploy is involved in the actual transaction between employers and candidates. M-Ploy get the details of the job applicants and the interns.
        When the Employers post a job opportunity for the interns, M-Ploy will screen the CVs of the interns to select the best interns for the opportunity. After short listing the interns the list will be send to the employer by the M-Ploy. For the automated screening process, we consider the weightage given by the employer for the relevant categories. Then the shortlisted interns will get by the employer. They can check the profiles of those interns and select the interns that they want to call for the interview and can send back to the M-Ploy. M-Ploy would call for the interview and the interns can accept or reject the request. After calling for the interview rest of the transactions have to be handle by the job applicants and the employer.
        In job applicants they have to apply for the jobs posted by the employer. The employer can decide the weightage they consider and employer have to run the selection process using M-Ploy.
        M-Ploy pays much attention for the privacy of the users. So, M-Ploy user cannot get the details of the other users from the M-Ploy database.
        Because User authentication on the Internet is difficult, M-Ploy cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Because we do not and cannot be involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of participants on any M-Ploy Site, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more Users, You release M-Ploy (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes to the fullest extent permitted by law.

The use of all M-Ploy Sites and the M-Ploy Content is at Your own risk. Changes are periodically made to M-Ploy Sites and may be made at any time. M-Ploy cannot guarantee and does not promise any specific results from use of any M-Ploy Site. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by a User from M-Ploy or through or from any M-Ploy Site shall create any warranty not expressly stated herein.
        M-Ploy encourages You to keep a back-up copy of any of Your User Content. To the extent permitted by law, in no event shall M-Ploy be liable for the deletion, loss, or unauthorized modification of any User Content.
